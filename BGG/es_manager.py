''' Provides the ESManager class. This class provides the interface to write the
boardgame documents to Elasticsearch. 

It uses the es_sink library to send the data and handle all auth. At the moment
the endpoint and other parameters are hard coded in the __init__ method via the
ESDescriptor object. See descriptor.py in the es_sink package for details on the
possible values for these parameters. 

It might be worth it to make those parameters available on the command line, but
hey, it's demo code!
